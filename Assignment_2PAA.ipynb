    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "Ans.  A class can be instantiated but a module cannot. A module will never be anything other than a library of methods.\n",

    "Ans. The two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code are Inheritance and Polymorphism.\n",
    "Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.\n",
    "The benefits of inheritance are: \n",
    " \n",
    "1.It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "2.It provides reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. \n",
    "Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "3.It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would \n",

    "The word polymorphism means having many forms. \n",
