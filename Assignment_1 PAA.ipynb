    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "Ans. Object-oriented programming provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled\n",
    "into individual objects.\n",
    "•OOP provides the feature of reusability of classes with the help of which, it is easy to use all the classes \n",
    "again that have already been created previously.Code reusability is one of the characteristics of object-oriented programming,\n",
    "which is done by inheritance OOP concept.\n",
    "•It allows for the parallel development of classes due to which object oriented programming is considered \n",
    "as the quickest way of development for completing the programs.\n",
    "•The coding in OOP is easy to maintain due to centralised coding base,making it easy to create maintainable \n",
    "procedure code. It also makes it easy for keeping all the data accessible while executing and upgrading it.\n",
    "•It is a useful approach or a process that helps in improving the security of entire programming.\n",
    "•Code management in OOPs also becomes very easy as all the code is divided into a number of elements. \n",
    "It also allows the programmers to initialize the object variable as well as call the function easily. \n",
    "•Data redundancy is another major benefit of OOPS, which is a condition created where the data is stored \n",
    "and this similar piece of data is also shared into different places. According to this, \n",
    "if a user requires the similar functionality in multiple classes then an individual can easily go ahead. \n",
    "This can be done by using common class definitions for the particular functionalities as well as inheriting them \n",
    "in an efficient way."

    "Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "Ans. when searching for attributes in inheritance search, Python looks in object first. \n",
    "The first occurrence of attribute starts by looking in object, then in all classes above it,\n",
    "from bottom to top and left to right. Attribute fetches are simply tree searches. \n",
    "The term inheritance is applied because objects lower in a tree inherit attributes attached to objects higher in that tree.\n",
    "As the search proceeds from the bottom up, in a sense, the objects linked into a tree are the union of all the attributes \n",
    "defined in all their tree parents, all the way up the tree."
